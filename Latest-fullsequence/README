The sequence is the baseline example to run the full simulation starting from the event generation.
Feel free to change the event type in the Gauss Option.
The scripts fake the production , digitisation and reconstruction made by the latest production (sim+std://MC/Upgrade/Beam7000GeV-Upgrade-MagDown-Nu7.6-25ns-Pythia8/Sim08h-NoRichSpill/Reco15U2)

If you want to adapt it to local DDDB or test of different version of Brunel/Boole change the option file and provide a new set of option file to do so for fair comparisons of "Default" to "With Changes"
